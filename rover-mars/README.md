# Rover Mars Mission Challenge v0.1

## Introduction

Youâ€™re part of the team that explores Mars by sending remotely controlled vehicles to the surface
of the planet. Develop a software that translates the commands sent from earth to instructions
that are understood by the rover.

## Requirements

- You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the direction (N,S,E,W)
it is facing.
- The rover receives a collection of commands. (E.g.) FFRRFFFRL
- The rover can move forward (f).
- The rover can move left/right (l,r).
- Suppose we are on a really weird planet that is square. 200x200 for example :)
- Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new square. If a given
sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last
possible point, aborts the sequence and reports the obstacle.

## Solution

I defined the `current location` of the rover with **x** and **y** axis in order to know its position in the map. Then I defined where the rover is facing (North, South, East or West). Moreover, rover has a `status obstacle` to know if there is an obstacle infront of it.

Moving through the map it is possible to the rover by giving orders on clicking to the buttons `Forward`, `Right` and `Left`. Moving forward simply means that the rover is moving x or y axial depending where it is facing and if there are no obstacles infront of him. By clicking right or left, the rover rotates his cardinal point.

## TODO
- Create obstacle detecion function 
- Create style
- Refactor

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
